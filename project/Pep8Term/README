This is the README file from the package Pep8Term.zip

The package contains the C++ source of the command-line
terminal version of the system described in "Computer Systems",
Fourth edition, J. Stanley Warford, Jones and Bartlett, Publishers,
2009.  ISBN 0-7637-3239-7

The package contains the Pep/8 assembler used to produce the
program listings in the textbook. It also includes a simulator
that executes the object code from the assembler. Students write
assembler source code in their favorite text editor and invoke
the assembler on the command line. After a successful assembly,
they run the simulator, which includes run-time debugging
facilities. Input/output is with standard C++ streams so that
batch jobs can be scripted with Unix scripting languages. This
is an ideal way to test and print large numbers of student
homework assignments.

Installation
------------
A makefile is included for one-step installation with the make
command. The makefile consists of two C++ compile commands, one
for the assembler and one for the simulator.

Files
-----
Here is a list of the files included in the package. They are all
text files that can be examined with the cat or more command.

README
This file of general information.

asem8.cpp
The C++ source file for the Pep/8 assembler.
After executing the make command, the assebler executable is placed
in a file named asem8.

pep8.cpp
The C++ source file for the Pep/8 simulator.
After executing the make command, the simulator executable is placed
in a file named pep8.

makefile
The script for the C++ compile commands to build the executables.

pep8os.pep
The source code of the Pep/8 operating system. See Chapter 8 of the
textbook for a complete description.

pep8os.pepo
The object code from pep8os.pep. This program is required to be in
the same directory as pep8 when it executes. This file could be
generated by assembling pep8os.pep with the asem8 program as follows:
asem8 pep8os.pep

pep8os.pepl
The program listing from pep8os.pep. This file could be generated by
assembling pep8os.pep with the asem8 program using the listing option
as follows:
asem8 -l pep8os.pep

trap
A text file that contains the mnemonics of the trap instructions.
This file is used by both asem8 and pep8. It is required to be in
the same directory as these executables. Pep/8 has several unimplemented
opcodes that execute as synchronous traps. The trap mechanism is
described in Section 8.2 of the textbook. The trap instructions include
several no-operation instructions with mnemonics NOP, NOP0, NOP1, NOP2,
and NOP3. Students can write their own trap handlers by modifying the
the operating system source, pep8os.pep. If they change the NOP mnemonics
by editing this file, they can use their new mnemonics in their assembly
language programs and can see the mnemonics displayed in the debugging
facilities of the simulator. Problems 8.26 - 8.33 in the textbook
are all problems to implement new instructions via trap handlers.

chap05
A directory containing all the programs from Chapter 5 of the textbook.

chap06
A directory containing all the programs from Chapter 6 of the textbook.

trap file placement
-------------------
The assembler and simulator need access to the file named "trap". If you
want to execute from a directory different from the one containing the
executable applications, you should include a copy of trap in the directory
from which you are executing.

Usage
-----
The names of all Pep/8 assembly language source files must end in ".pep". 
The assembler produces the object code in a file of the same name, but
ending in ".pepo". If you use the listing option -l, the program listing
is placed in a file with the same name but ending in ".pepl". When you
run the simulator, the first command you should execute is the (l)oad
command.

Here is a terminal session to assemble and execute the program fig0503.pep
in the directory chap05. It is Figure 5.3 in the textbook.

========================================
bash-2.05$ ./asem8 -l chap05/fig0503.pep
bash-2.05$ ./pep8
64599 bytes RAM free.

(l)oad  e(x)ecute  (d)ump  (t)race  (i)nput  (o)utput  (q)uit: l
Enter object file name (do not include .pepo): chap05/fig0503
Object file is chap05/fig0503.pepo

(l)oad  e(x)ecute  (d)ump  (t)race  (i)nput  (o)utput  (q)uit: x
Hi
(l)oad  e(x)ecute  (d)ump  (t)race  (i)nput  (o)utput  (q)uit: q
bash-2.05$ 
========================================

If you omit -l with asem8, the program listing file will not be created.

The (d)ump command displays a dump of memory on the screen.
The (t)race command allows the user to trace the loader, or the program,
or the program including the trap handlers.
The (i)nput command lets the user specify either the keyboard or a file
for input. Default is the keyboard.
The (o)utput command lets the user specify either the screen or a file
for output. Default is the screen.
